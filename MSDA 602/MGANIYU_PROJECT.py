The dataset was divided into 4 equal strata and regression analysis was done on each group to verify the effect of population on crimes. A larger population seems to affect the crime rate, while small population has little or no effect on the crimes. ")

text = 'The UCR Program collects statistics on the number of offenses known to law enforcement.  In the traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS), there are eight crimes, or Part I offenses, (murder and nonnegligent homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, larceny-theft, and arson) to be reported to the UCR Program.  These offenses were chosen because they are serious crimes, they occur with regularity in all areas of the country, and they are likely to be reported to police.  The Part I offenses are defined as:Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter: the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another. Deaths caused by negligence, attempts to kill, assaults to kill, suicides, and accidental deaths are excluded.  The program classifies justifiable homicides separately and limits the definition to:  (1) the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty; or (2) the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen. b.) Manslaughter by negligence: the killing of another person through gross negligence. Deaths of persons due to their own negligence, accidental deaths not resulting from gross negligence, and traffic fatalities are not included in the category Manslaughter by Negligence.The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.  Rapes by force and attempts or assaults to rape, regardless of the age of the victim, are included.  Statutory offenses (no force usedâ€”victim under age of consent) are excluded.The taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear.An unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury.  This type of assault usually is accompanied by the use of a weapon or by means likely to produce death or great bodily harm.  Simple assaults are excluded.The unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or a theft.  Attempted forcible entry is included.The unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the possession or constructive possession of another.  Examples are thefts of bicycles, motor vehicle parts and accessories, shoplifting, pocketpicking, or the stealing of any property or article that is not taken by force and violence or by fraud.  Attempted larcenies are included.  Embezzlement, confidence games, forgery, check fraud, etc., are excluded.The theft or attempted theft of a motor vehicle.  A motor vehicle is self-propelled and runs on land surface and not on rails.  Motorboats, construction equipment, airplanes, and farming equipment are specifically excluded from this category.Any willful or malicious burning or attempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of another, etc. Arson statistics are not included in this table-building tool.'
