>  Please write a function to compute the expected value and standard deviation of an array of values.

```{r}

num <- c(2,4,5,6,7,8,5,6,7,6,7,8,8,9,4,9)

expectedValue <- function(num){
  return(sum(num)/length(num))
}

mean(num) == expectedValue(num)# Checking



standardDeviation <- function(num){
  return(sqrt(sum((num-expectedValue(num))^2)/(length(num)-1)))
}

sd(num) == standardDeviation(num) #Checking

```
```{python}
import numpy
```

 > Now, consider that instead of being able to neatly  t the values in memory in an array,
you have an in nite stream of numbers coming by.  How would you estimate the mean and
standard deviation of such a stream?  Your function should be able to return the current
estimate of the mean and standard deviation at any time it is asked.  Your program should
maintain these current estimates and return them back at any invocation of these functions.

```{R}
 
rolling<<-NA

    
rollingfunc <- function(x) {
   
 
   if (is.na(rolling[1]) == TRUE) rolling<<- rolling[-1]
  
 
    rolling<<- c(rolling, assign("rolling", x, envir = .GlobalEnv))
    

   print(data.frame(rolling))
   
 
  return(data.frame(mean = expectedValue(rolling), std = standardDeviation(rolling) ))
}


 
vector <- rnorm(n = 50000, mean = 250, sd = 4.5 )

rollingfunc(vector)

```
